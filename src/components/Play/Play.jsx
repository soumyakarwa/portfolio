        description="I've always been fascinated with the relationship between light & time. And how sometimes, the stars we see in the night sky might have already died, because they might be so far away that their light has taken years to reach us. We see stars that are billions of light-years away as they were billions of years ago. I find it really profound that light (or waves itself) creates a difference between the time at which things happen and the time at which we are able to see them."

When I try to imagine objects Iâ€™ve lost, the image is always blurry - distant. I can picture the item, but I can never quite picture where I lost it. To convey this, I randomized the position of the bracelet in the airport. Each time the program is run, the bracelet is in a different position, depicting it as truly lost."
